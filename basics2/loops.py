# Iterable - something that is able to get looped over
# FOR LOOPS
# for sth in Iterable:
#    ...

for item in 'Zero to Mastery':
    print(item)

for item in [1, 2, 3]:  # works with lists, sets, tuples
    print(item)
print(item)  # still works, prints 3

# my own example for dictionary, looping over keys - names
pet_owners = {'Anna': 'cat', 'John': 'dog'}
for i in pet_owners.keys():  # goes over keys anyway if just left as pet_owners
    print(i + ' has a ' + pet_owners.get(i))

for i in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5):
    for x in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
        print(i, x)  # first takes 1, prints with a, b, c, escapes the inner loop to get to prints it with letters etcâ€¦

# iterable - list, dictionary, tuple, set, string
# iterated - one by one check each item in the collection
